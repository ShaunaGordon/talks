Before we dive in, I want to go over a few preliminary assumptions for this tutorial. We have a lot of ground to cover in a fairly short block of time, so this does assume you have a base level of technical skill (shouldn't be an issue here), a Github account already created, and git installed on your machine.

I can't really go into installing git here, the process is simply a bit too system-dependent. However, tools like VSCode or Github Desktop will often install it for you, or provide a path to doing so, and Mac and some Linux distros often have some version installed by default already.

Don't worry if you're not quite to this point yet. I have some additional resources at the end of this slide deck, which itself is available online at talks.shaunagordon.com. A recording of the talk itself will also be available to WiA members and VIP attendees.
