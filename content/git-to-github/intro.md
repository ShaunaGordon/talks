Hi!

I've been a software engineer for over a decade, and struck out on my own as an independent consultant about two years ago. I do full stack web application development, particularly for startups and small businesses, particularly in the education tech and e-commerce industries.

(Full disclosure - I'm rather tangential to analytics, so I am approaching this from that angle, and some of the tech-specific things might need adapted to your own use-cases, but there should be plenty of cross-over for that to not be an issue.)

You can find me in the WiA Slack group, as well as Write the Docs, Code & Supply, and the Tech Life Columbus, among a few other more niche ones.

You can also reach me and get my information via my website and email. My resume site serves as a sort of hub for my online presence in general.
